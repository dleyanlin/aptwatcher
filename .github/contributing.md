# Contributing

We love pull requests, and we're even happy to receive patches by email.  :)

Please use idiomatic Ruby and match the existing code style as much as possible.

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes
submitted to the AptWatcher project and assign the copyright of
those changes to Honeybadger Industries LLC.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours".
99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you
away from contributing.
